## How to Run

## Experiment 1

a. `The value for k=13 is specifically chosen because it will introduce cycles in the graph given the genome we’re using.`

- `Find a part of the original genome’s sequence that causes this cycle and explain why it causes a cycle (hint: it’s at the end of the sequence).`
- `In your implementation: do you break the cycle during bubble popping or are you breaking the cycle somewhere else (e.g., in reconstructing the sequence)? Why did you choose to do it this way?`
